# Rock vs Mine

## Introduction
Rock vs Mine is a project that focuses on predicting whether an object in sonar data represents a rock or a mine. By utilizing machine learning techniques, this project aims to develop a prediction system that can accurately classify sonar readings as either a rock or a mine. The system can be used in various applications such as underwater object detection and naval operations.

## Features
- Designed a prediction system to classify objects in sonar data as either a rock or a mine.
- Utilized machine learning algorithms to train a model on labeled sonar data.
- Achieved an accuracy of 76.2% using a Logistic Regression Model.
- The system employs feature engineering techniques to extract meaningful information from the sonar data.
- Utilized libraries such as Sklearn, Pandas, NumPy, and Python for data processing, model training, and evaluation.
- The trained model can be used to predict the classification of new sonar readings.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Install the required dependencies by running: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Prepare your dataset by ensuring it follows the required format.
4. Run the main application script: `python rock_vs_mine.py`

## Usage
1. Ensure that the dataset is properly loaded and preprocessed by running the data preprocessing script: `python data_preprocessing.py`.
2. Train the machine learning model by executing the training script: `python train_model.py`.
3. Once the model is trained, the main application script can be used to predict whether an object in sonar data is a rock or a mine: `python rock_vs_mine.py`.
